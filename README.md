# Skeem
__Skeem__ will be an interpreter of a subset of the Scheme programming language.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'skeem'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install skeem

## Usage

The __Skeem__ project has just started.
At this stage, it is too early to use the gem.  

Roadmap:
- Implement an equivalent of [lis.py](http://www.norvig.com/lispy.html)
- Implement an equivalent of [lispy](http://norvig.com/lispy2.html)
- Make it pass the test suite
- Extend the language in order to support [Minikanren](https://github.com/TheReasonedSchemer2ndEd/CodeFromTheReasonedSchemer2ndEd)
- Make it pass all examples from the [Reasoned Schemer](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/reasoned-schemer-second-edition) book.

TODO: Write usage instructions here

Good to know:
Online book: [The Scheme Programming Language (4th Ed.)](https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/)
  
## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.
Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console`
for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`,
which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
